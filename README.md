## Ruslan Osipov's Theme - For iTerm2, QTerminal, xfce4-terminal

I came across a delightful theme as part of Mintty on Windows, called `rospiov`. I fell in love and
wanted to use it in my other terminals. This color scheme was created by [Ruslan Ospivov](https://www.rosipov.com)
and the values are taken directly from [his blog post here](https://www.rosipov.com/blog/mintty-color-scheme-cygwin/).

There are two versions: the original values or one with a brighter foreground value.

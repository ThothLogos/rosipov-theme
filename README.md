## Ruslan Osipov's theme

I came across a fantastic theme called 'rosipov' in Git-Bash for Windows. I wanted to use it in my QTerminals as well. This color scheme was created by [Ruslan Ospivov](https://www.rosipov.com) and the values are taken directly from [his blog post here](https://www.rosipov.com/blog/mintty-color-scheme-cygwin/).

### Installation

I've only tested this on Kali so far, but the themes are found at `/usr/share/qtermwidget5/color-schemes` for me. Pop this `Rosipov.colorscheme` file in there, restart `qterminal` and it should show up as an option in your Appearance preferences.
